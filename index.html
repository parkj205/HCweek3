            My old Black on Black superstars have a giant hole that I tried patching up with glue, but it didn't work. So i decided to take this opportunity to get a new pair.

            originally, I was going to get the classic black and white versions, however I saw these on ebay and really loved the color and detailing on the soles plus they were in my size. These were the only active listing of these shoes and knew i couldn't pass it up. Original price was 80$, i offered 65 and they accepted :)
